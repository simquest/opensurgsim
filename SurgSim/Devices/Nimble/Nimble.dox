\page Nimble Nimble: Hand tracking using the NimbleSDK and OpenNI.

NimbleSDK (http://www.threegear.com/download.html), by Three Gear Systems, is a hand tracking software which can communicate (using OpenNI) with a range of special depth cameras, and use the data to calculate the pose of the (two) hands in view.

The software for NimbleSDK consists of the driver for the camera (OpenNI installer is packaged with the SDK) and the hand tracking server, which needs to be started and be running for the NimbleDevice to receive data. The steps to start the server are described here (http://www.threegear.com/latest/doc/index.html) for Windows and Mac OSX.
