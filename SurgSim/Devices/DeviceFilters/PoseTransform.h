/// A device filter that transforms the input pose.  It can scale the translation, and/or apply a constant transform.
/// Any other data in the DataGroup is passed through.  For an input/output device (e.g., a haptic device), the filter
/// should be added as one of the device's input consumers and set as the device's output producer.  For a purely input
/// device, the filter can just be added as an input consumer.  If it is used for both input and output, the input data
/// is filtered using the offset(s) and scaling, and the output data is un-filtered so the device does not need to know
/// about the filtering.
/// For haptic devices, so that changing the translation scaling does not alter the relationship between displayed
/// forces and collision penetrations, the output filter does not scale the nominal forces and torques, and it does
/// scale the Jacobians.  Thereby the displayed forces and torques are appropriate for the scene (not the device-space
/// motions).  In other words, a 1 m motion by the device's scene representation generates forces according to that 1 m
/// motion, instead of the original device motion before scaling.  This means the device displays forces and torques
/// that are "true" to the scene, with the consequence that increasing the translation scaling can negatively impact the
/// haptic stability.  As the scaling increases, the same motion would cause larger forces, until at great enough
/// scaling the system becomes unstable (either when colliding with another scene element, or just due to over-damping).
/// Consider chaining this device filter with a force scaling device filter to improve system stability.
