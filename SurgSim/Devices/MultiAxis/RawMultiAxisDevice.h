/// A class implementing the communication with a multi-axis controller input device, for example a 3DConnexion
/// SpaceNavigator.
///
/// This object will only generate raw output reported by the controller, which indicates the
/// movement of the controller from its rest state.  Normally, that result will need to be integrated to allow the
/// controller to be treated as a differential device, where holding the controller moves the pose and releasing
/// the controller lets the pose hold steady in its new state.  The MultiAxisDevice class provides that.
