/// Fem Element 3D co-rotational based on a tetrahedron volume discretization
/// \note This class derives from the linear version of the FEM 3D element tetrahedron, adding a rigid frame
/// \note attached to the tetrahedron element to follow its rigid motion. Therefore it computes deformation in the
/// \note local coordinate system of the tetrahedron. This class is based on 2 papers:
/// \note "Interactive Virtual Materials", Muller, Gross. Graphics Interface 2004
/// \note "Exact Corotational Linear FEM Stiffness Matrix", Jernej Barbic. Technical Report USC 2012.
/// \note Only the force and stiffness calculation are different, involving some changes as well in addMatVec
/// \note (it uses the updated stiffness matrix).
/// \note The update method takes care of extracting the rigid motion of the element.
/// \note This element is updating its stiffness matrix at each new time step, which means that it cannot
/// \note be used with any OdeSolverLinearXXX, it needs an ode solver that recomputes the data at each iteration.
