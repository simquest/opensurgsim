/// This extends \ref SurgSim::Math::MlcpProblem "the pure mathematical MLCP problem" by storing the intermediate
/// matrices \ref H and \ref CHt that are necessary to physically interpret the solution.
///
/// Note that the matrix \f$\mathbf{A}\f$ used in the MlcpProblem is computed in the physical problem as
/// \f$\mathbf{H\;C\;H^T}\f$, where \f$\mathbf{C}\f$ is the compliance matrix.  For contact constraints, \f$b\f$ is
/// the initial signed displacements between the colliding representations, \f$b_i \lt 0\f$ when the representations
/// interpenetrate, \f$x\f$ is the forces to apply at each contact to prevent penetration, and \f$c\f$ is the signed
/// displacements after the forces are applied.
/// \note The solution to the MLCP will only address the constraints that were provided, and application of \f$x\f$ to
/// the representations in the scene may cause new collisions for constraints that were not originally incorporated in
/// the MLCP.
