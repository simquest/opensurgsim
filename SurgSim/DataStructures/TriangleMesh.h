/// Basic class for storing Triangle Meshes, handling basic vertex, edge, and triangle functionality.
///
/// TriangleMesh is to be used purely as a data structure and not provide implementation of algorithms.
/// For example, a physics 2D FEM is not a subclass of TriangleMesh, but may use a TriangleMesh for storing the
/// structure of the FEM.
///
/// It is recommended that subclasses with a specific purpose (such as for use in collision detection) provide
/// convenience methods for creation of vertices, edges, and triangles and the data each contains. Methods such as
/// createVertex(position, other data...), createEdge(vertices, other data...),
/// and createTriangle(vertices, other data...) simplify the creation of vertices and elements and the data required.
/// These methods would use the addVertex(), addEdge(), and addTriangle() methods to add the created vertices and
/// elements to the TriangleMesh.
///
/// Overriding isEqual(const Mesh&) is necessary to do more than just basic list comparison of the
/// vertices, edges, and triangles, which is dependent on order in the list.
///
/// Override doUpdate() to provide update functionality when vertices are changes, such as recalculating surface
/// normals.
///
/// A subclass that is designed for a specific use (such as collision detection) may also specify the VertexData,
/// EdgeData, and TriangleData to what is required.
