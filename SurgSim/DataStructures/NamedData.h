/// name is more convenient, but less efficient.
///
/// A NamedData object constructed by the default constructor has no entries, meaning it has not been associated with a

///
/// An <i>non</i>-empty object contains an immutable collection of entries.  For a non-empty object: entries cannot be
/// added or removed, and the entries' names and indices <b>cannot be changed</b>.  Further, a non-empty object cannot
/// become empty. These properties ensure that a stable data layout is available to the code using this class so
/// that it can, for example, record entry indices and use them to retrieve the same entries later on.
