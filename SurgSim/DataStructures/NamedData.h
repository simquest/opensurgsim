/// A NamedData object contains a collection of values of type \a T.  Each entry in the collection can be
/// accessed by using either its unique name (a std::string) or its unique index (a non-negative integer).
/// Access by name is more convenient, but also less efficient.
///
/// A NamedData object constructed by the default constructor starts out empty, meaning it has not yet been
/// associated with a set of names and indices.  A <i>non</i>-empty object contains a fixed set of value entries;
/// entries <b>cannot be added or removed</b>, and names and indices of existing entries
/// <b>cannot be changed</b>.  A non-empty object also cannot ever become empty again.  These properties ensure
/// that a stable data layout is available to the code using this class so that it can, for example, record
/// entry indices and use them to retrieve the same entries later on.
///
/// However, each entry can be marked as not currently valid, i.e. missing.  Its entry still remains in the
/// collection, but for the moment has no value associated with it.
///
/// The set of names and indices within a NamedData object object cannot be modified, but it can be initialized
/// by passing in a vector of names to the constructor.  Alternately, you can initialize the data layout using
/// the \ref NamedDataBuilder class.  After doing that, you can create other objects with the same layout by
/// copy construction, or by assigning the initialized value to an empty (default-constructed) NamedData object.
