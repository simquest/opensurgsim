/// SurfaceMeshShape defines a shape based on a mesh, like MeshShape.
/// But, unlike MeshShape, the mesh does not need to be watertight to produce valid volume, center and second moment of
/// volume. In the MeshShape case, these quantities are based on the notion of volume and are therefore undefined
/// if no volume if properly defined. In the SurfaceMeshShape case, these quantities are based on a surface
/// mesh, with a thickness (which is considered constant over the surface and should be multiple orders of magnitude
/// smaller than the two other dimesions, i.e. 1e-3 in practice). If the mesh is not closed or has holes, the class
/// will still produce valid geometric properties.
///
/// \note If not used in physics, there is no differences between using a SurfaceMeshShape or a MeshShape.
///
/// \note Any change on the mesh will invalidate the geometric properties.
/// \note Practical use cases:
/// \note * Fixed/Rigid object, the mesh will not change anyway.
/// \note * Deformable  object, the mesh will be updated, but the geometric properties will not be used.
///
/// \note The thickness should be multiple order of magnitude smaller than the other 2 dimensions of the mesh.
/// \note It should also not be smaller than 1e-5 to avoid formal and numerical issues when getting close to 0.
///
/// \note SurfaceMeshShape does not have any collision algorithm associated with it in SurgSim::Collision and
/// \note SurgSim::Physics::DcdCollision so far.
