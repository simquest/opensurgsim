///
/// The type of the contained data is determined by the template argument, and should satisfy the following:
///  - It must be either copy-assignable or move-assignable.  In other words, assignment must be possible using
///    either <code>operator=(const T&)</code> or <code>operator=(T&&)</code>, or compiler-generated equivalents.
///  - It must be either default-constructable or copy-constructable.  In other words, construction must be
///    possible using either <code>T()</code> or <code>T(const T&)</code>, or compiler-generated equivalents.
/// Note that STL container types, plain-old-data structs, and most other things you might want to use satisfy
/// those requirements.
///
/// The container will create two instances of the data internally.
///
/// Writers set the data by calling the \ref set method, which copies or moves the data into internal storage.
///
/// The reader requests its view of the data to be updated by calling the \ref update method, and can access the data
/// between updates by "dereferencing" the container using the <code>*</code> or <code>-&gt;</code> operators.
